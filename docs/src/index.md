# Distributions Package

The *Distributions* package provides a large collection of probabilistic distributions and related functions. Particularly, *Distributions* implements:

* Sampling from distributions
* Moments (*e.g* mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis), entropy, and other properties
* Probability density/mass functions (pdf) and their logarithm (logpdf)
* Moment-generating functions and characteristic functions
* Maximum likelihood estimation
* Distribution composition (Cartesian product of distributions, truncated distributions)
